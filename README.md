ChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) model developed by OpenAI. It is a transformer-based language model that uses deep learning to generate human-like responses to user input. ChatGPT can be used to create interactive chatbots, virtual assistants, and other conversational AI applications. It is trained on millions of conversations from public sources such as Reddit and Twitter, and can generate realistic responses to user input.
